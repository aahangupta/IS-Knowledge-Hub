IS Knowledge Hub - AI-Powered Construction Standards Engine

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Build an AI-powered platform that transforms Indian Standards (IS) Codes for construction into a structured, searchable, and intelligent knowledge base. The system will parse BIS documents (IS 10262, IS 456, IS 383, IS 2386, etc.) into clean structured Markdown, embed them into a vector database, and enable chat-based RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) using advanced LLMs like GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Pro.

TARGET USERS:
- Site engineers and quality control (QC) personnel
- RMC (ready-mix concrete) lab technicians
- Construction managers and consultants
- Material manufacturers and suppliers
- AI agents operating in dispatch, QA/QC, or test automation
- Auditors and compliance teams during project inspections

CORE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. PDF Parsing and Ingestion Module
   - Upload IS code PDFs through Streamlit interface
   - Parse each page using GPT-4o vision capabilities
   - Convert to structured Markdown with:
     * YAML frontmatter (title, version, code, publication date)
     * Proper heading hierarchy (## Clause 5.1, ### Sub-clause 5.1.1)
     * Tables converted to markdown format
     * Equations in LaTeX syntax ($...$)
     * Image references with captions
   - Handle multi-column layouts and complex formatting
   - Save parsed .md files with proper naming convention
   - Support batch processing of multiple PDFs

2. Document Processing Pipeline
   - Chunk markdown documents by clause headers
   - Maintain ~1000 token chunks with 200 token overlap
   - Preserve metadata: clause ID, code name, version, section, page numbers
   - Handle nested clause structures (5.1, 5.1.1, 5.1.1.a)
   - Generate unique identifiers for each chunk
   - Support re-chunking on edited documents

3. Vector Embedding System
   - Generate embeddings using text-embedding-3-small or bge-base-en-v1.5
   - Store embeddings in Pinecone vector database
   - Include rich metadata for filtering and retrieval
   - Support batch embedding generation
   - Handle embedding updates for modified content
   - Implement efficient similarity search

4. Search and Retrieval Engine
   - Semantic search across all IS code content
   - Support natural language queries
   - Filter by IS code, version, or specific sections
   - Return top-k relevant chunks with scores
   - Highlight matching clauses in results
   - Support exact phrase matching alongside semantic search

5. RAG Question-Answering System
   - Process user queries through GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - Retrieve relevant context from vector database
   - Generate comprehensive answers with:
     * Direct clause citations (e.g., IS 10262:2019 â€“ Clause 4.2.1)
     * Relevant tables and formulas
     * Cross-references to related clauses
   - Implement fallback between LLM providers
   - Stream responses for better UX

6. Streamlit User Interface
   - Clean, professional dashboard layout
   - Upload interface with drag-and-drop support
   - Search interface with auto-suggestions
   - Results display with expandable clause views
   - Export functionality for:
     * Full IS codes as PDF/Markdown
     * Selected clauses or sections
     * Search results with citations
   - Dark/light theme toggle
   - Mobile-responsive design

7. Supabase Integration
   - Store document metadata (name, version, upload date, user)
   - Track clause-to-file mappings
   - User authentication and role management
   - Query history and analytics
   - Audit logs for compliance
   - Version control for document updates

8. API Development
   - FastAPI endpoints for all core functions
   - RESTful API design
   - Authentication via JWT tokens
   - Rate limiting and usage tracking
   - Swagger documentation
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates

3. Security and Compliance
   - Encrypt all data at rest and in transit
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit trail for all operations
   - GDPR compliance for user data
   - Regular security audits

4. Monitoring and Analytics
   - Track query patterns and popular clauses
   - Monitor system performance metrics
