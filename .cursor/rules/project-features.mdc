# 📦 Features – IS Code AI Knowledge Engine

This system transforms BIS IS Code PDFs into structured Markdown, embeds them for semantic search, and enables intelligent clause-level queries using GPT-4o/Gemini.

---

## ✅ Core Features (MVP)

### 📘 IS Code Ingestion
- [x] Upload IS code PDFs (e.g., IS 10262, IS 456)
- [x] Parse each page using GPT-4o
- [x] Convert to structured Markdown:
  - YAML frontmatter (`title`, `version`, `code`, etc.)
  - Headings and clause references (`## Clause 5.1`)
  - Tables in markdown format
  - Equations in LaTeX syntax (`$...$`)
  - Image references (`![Figure](figures/FigX.png)`)
- [x] Save parsed `.md` file per document

### 🧱 Chunking & Embedding
- [x] Chunk markdown by clause headers or ~1000 tokens
- [x] Add metadata: clause ID, code name, version, section, line range
- [x] Embed using `text-embedding-3-small` or `bge-base-en-v1.5`
- [x] Store chunks in Pinecone vector database

### 🔍 Search & Query
- [x] Semantic search over IS code content
- [x] Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Pro
- [x] Return answer with linked clause citations (e.g., `IS 10262:2019 – Clause 4.2.1`)
- [x] Multi-model querying fallback (GPT ↔ Claude/Gemini)

### 🖥️ Streamlit User Interface
- [x] Upload IS code files (PDF)
- [x] View parsed Markdown clause-by-clause
- [x] Ask questions and get GPT answers with clause references
- [x] Export:
  - Full IS code
  - Selected clause or section
  - Markdown or plain text

## ⚙️ Engineering Features

### 🗃 Supabase Integration
- [x] Store metadata for uploaded codes (name, version, uploader, timestamp)
- [x] Track clause-to-file mapping
- [x] Future: Store edits, clause version history, audit logs

### 📦 Data Pipeline
- [x] Parse → Markdown → Chunk → Embed → Store (automated flow)
- [x] Retry/error detection during parsing or chunking
- [x] Re-chunking supported on edited Markdown
