# 🏗️ Project Overview – IS Code Construction Knowledge Engine

## 🔍 Purpose

This project aims to build an AI-powered platform that transforms Indian Standards (IS) Codes for construction into a structured, searchable, and intelligent knowledge base. It enables engineers, QC personnel, auditors, RMC plants, and field teams to instantly access regulatory insights, mix design rules, and code-compliant procedures.

The system will parse BIS documents like **IS 10262, IS 456, IS 383, IS 2386**, etc., into **clean structured Markdown**, embed them into a **vector database**, and enable **chat-based RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)** using advanced LLMs like GPT-4o or Gemini 2.5 Pro.

---

## 🧑‍🎓 Target Users

- Site engineers and quality control (QC) personnel
- RMC (ready-mix concrete) lab technicians
- Construction managers and consultants
- Material manufacturers and suppliers
- AI agents operating in dispatch, QA/QC, or test automation
- Auditors and compliance teams during project inspections

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Indian construction projects rely heavily on BIS codes for specifications, material design, durability, and compliance. Yet these codes are locked in unstructured PDFs and hard to query in real time.

This system:
- Makes IS code clauses queryable, contextual, and citeable
- Reduces dependency on experts for interpreting mix design clauses
- Enables faster onboarding of QC teams and AI agents
- Tracks code changes over time for regulatory traceability
- Forms the backbone of AI agents that can run tests, generate mix designs, and assist during site audits

---

## 🔧 Functional Highlights

- Parse IS code PDFs into structured markdown using GPT-4o
- Chunk by clause/section for precise semantic search
- Embed markdown into Pinecone for fast RAG
- Ask code-related questions and cite exact clauses
- Export markdown, tables, LaTeX, or full code sections
- Track amendments between versions (future)
- Streamlit-based frontend for rapid interface

---

## 🧱 Code Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone
- **Metadata DB:** Supabase
- **LLMs:** GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Embedding Models:** `text-embedding-3-small` / `bge-base-en-v1.5`
- **PDF parsing:** GPT-4o prompt-based per page
- **Dev tooling:** Cursor, Claude 4, version-controlled prompts

---

## 📦 Long-Term Vision

This becomes the foundation for:

- A **Construction AI Assistant** that understands codes, procedures, and test data
- An **LLM-integrated QC dashboard** for mix design validation and compliance checks
- A **live regulatory hub** for real-time BIS code updates and amendments
- A **training tool** for young engineers to understand concrete mix proportioning, testing, and IS norms
- A **partner product with Concrete.ai, Ultratech, or RMC labs** to power their internal QA systems
